# Nix Flake Templates

Flake templates that I use for personal projects. Primarily focused on
providing devShells for various language ecosystems so I don't need to
remember how to do that anymore.

## Usage

To initialize a new repository run the following (replace c-vcpkg with the
desired template):

```
nix flake init -t github:bookest/flake-templates#c-vcpkg
```
